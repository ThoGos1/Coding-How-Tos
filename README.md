# Coding How To's
This place for “Coding How To’s” for everyone who wants or needs to implement a system or feature into an existing program, or is just looking around for ideas for a project.
These Coding How To’s are easy to implement and are build-up for a task as an example, but can be quickly disassembled and restricted into something else.
