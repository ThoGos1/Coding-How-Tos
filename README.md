# Coding How To's
This place for “Coding How To’s” for everyone who wants or needs to implement a system or feature into an existing program, or is just looking around for ideas for a project.
These Coding How To’s are easy to implement and are build-up for a task as an example, but can be quickly disassembled and restricted into something else.


# FTSE 100
This Coding How To shows you how to simply scrape data from the internet with the Beautiful Soup module written in the language Python. The program uses the Request module and bs4 from the Beautiful Soup module to get the page data and find the specific component that you are looking for. This program uses the FTSE 100 Index and prints the value, but it can quickly be changed into a variable for something else like for loop parsing. The URL and the attributes can be easily changed to suit your program, and if anything is confusing the Beautiful Soup Documentation is your friend.

# Rock Paper Scissors
This Coding How To is a short and simple version of a Rock Paper Scissors program written in the language Python. The program uses the Random module and if statements to determine the outcome, and it uses an input statement for player interaction.
